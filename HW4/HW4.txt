Homework 4.5 (Chris Swint)

1) What are the parent and child classes here?

The parent class is "Spell" with two child classes being "Accio" and "Confundo" respectively.


2) What does the code print out? (Try figuring it out without running it in Python)

It should first print the incantation associated with the "Accio" Spell which is called by the execute function
in the generic spell class.  Then it runs the study_spell function twice both for the generic spell class and for
"Confundo" which should print the spells for each of these.


3) Which get description method is called when ‘study spell(Confundo())’ is executed? Why?

The get_description defined underneath the "Confundo" class should be called, not the one from the superclass Spell.
This should occur because the get_description under "Confundo" should overwrite the one that it inherits from Spell.


4) What do we need to do so that ‘print Accio()’ will print the appropriate description
(‘This charm summons an object to the caster, potentially over a significant distance’)?
Write down the code that we need to add and/or change.

We need to overwrite the inherited function get_description with a new function of the same name in the Accio class.  It
should be placed directly under the Accio init statement.  It should look something like this.

def get_description(self):
	return 'This charm summons an object to the caster, potentially over a significant distance.'
